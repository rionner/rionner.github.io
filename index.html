            <blockquote>
              Marion is one of the finest front-end engineers I've worked with, and was a major contributor to many of our key
              user-facing projects at Twelve.
              <br>
              <br>
              Marion created our design system and component library. She also built a number of complex interactive experiences,
              including an animated digital twin of our conveyorized assembly line, visual navigation for electrolyzer stacks with
              1000+ serialized components, frequency domain data exploration, and photo based defect identification. For the latter,
              she developed browser-based image processing code and communicated with an attached camera. She also worked on
              full-stack projects that involved writing back-end code.
              <br>
              <br>
              Marion is a top performer who reliably shipped her work on-time – which was impressive given her taking on our most
              complex front-end projects at Twelve, and provided mentorship and code review support to other engineers. She also
              excelled at documenting customer requirements and implementation plans, and asking key questions that informed the
              design process.
              <br>
              <br>
              I’ve very much enjoyed working with Marion, and would jump at an opportunity to do so again.

              I’ve had the privilege of working with Marion as a front-end developer in my role as a Product Manager, and she is truly
              incredible. Marion is whip-smart, learns quickly, and is not afraid to present new ideas or challenge existing ones—all
              with the goal of delivering the best possible user experience. Her deep understanding of front-end development, coupled
              with her passion for creating intuitive and accessible designs, consistently elevates the products we work on. She’s
              introduced new tools and approaches to our team, making a lasting impact on both our development process and our final
              products. Her contributions to accessibility and global styling have been especially valuable, and her thoughtful
              approach always keeps the long-term success of the product in mind.
              <br>
              <br>
              Marion is not only an excellent engineer but also a creative thinker and a collaborative teammate. She brings fresh,
              well-reasoned ideas to the table, and her input always adds tremendous value to any discussion. I can confidently say
              any team would benefit from Marion’s expertise and unique skill set. I would work with Marion again in a heartbeat!

              Marion is one of the most talented engineers I've ever had the pleasure of working with. She is deeply thoughtful in all
              aspects of her job - from the way she communicates with her teammates to the way she approaches technical challenges.
              Marion is deeply collaborative, working to understand the projects she is working on, and asking questions that drive
              more thorough specs that benefit the whole team. She executes on work consistently, quickly, and at a high level; using
              her deep knowledge of css and html to build components that are beautiful, usable, accessible, and future-proof. Any
              team would be lucky to have Marion working with them.

              Marion has great engineering instincts about what is important to both users and developers, how to build in a
              maintainable way, and make the user experience pleasurable. I often agreed with her clear explanations and reasoning in
              design discussions, and she was a great team member to work with.
              <br>
              <br>
              She is excellent at front-end development and introduced many new tools, tips, and tricks to the software team at
              Twelve. The team learned a ton from her, and I'm confident any org would be improved with her expertise!

              I met Marion Huebner in mid­ 2015 at a hiring event for a well­-reputed and extremely aggressive developer training program called General Assembly. Marion immediately stood out from the pack of dozens with her winning mix of passion, sociability, and raw talent. My partner and I hired her on the spot as a full­stack developer for our company, Aplo LLC. During her three­-month contract employment with Aplo she contributed significantly to the development of our innovative insurance CRM, quote engine, database, website, and enrollment technology. Marion is an excellent team­ player, a dilligent worker, an avid learner, and an overall excellent employee. I would highly recommend her for any junior­ level development positions your company has to offer. As a matter of fact, I would recommend her without hesitation for just about any position of any type ­- she is that good!

              Marion Huebner is a secret weapon. She is bright, logical, creative and nimble. The true source of her power is in her versatility. She applies her analytical mind when creating business proposals, engineering specifications, product prototypes, and business administration processes. And her creative side comes out when she designs websites, print pieces, and interior spaces. Regardless of the project type, you can count on Marion delivering solid professional results.
